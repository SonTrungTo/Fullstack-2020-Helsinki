## THE END
- This is the final part of the modern web development course. There are still part 10 (React Native) and part 11 (CI/CD),
but they have to be dealt with in separate repositories since that was what the instructions said, and
seperate certificates for each part will be given respectively.
- There may still be updates for links to part 10 and part 11.

## [Part 9](https://github.com/SonTrungTo/Fullstack-2020-Helsinki/tree/master/part9)
- Typescript and its ecosystem (Eslint, tsconfig). Built three different apps for this part:
a calculator, a courseinfo (from part 0) and a patientor app, the latest of which was designed
by developers at Terveystalo.
- Small note: The workload on this part is the heaviest, since we are dealing with both frontend
and backend, the former of which uses SemanticUI React and Formik to handle state management.
